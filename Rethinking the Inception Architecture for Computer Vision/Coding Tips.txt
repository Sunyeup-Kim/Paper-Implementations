* Consistent Variable Names. Use the same variable name for the input (visible) and output layers (output) and perhaps even the hidden layers (hidden1, hidden2). It will help to connect things together correctly.
* Review Layer Summary. Always print the model summary and review the layer outputs to ensure that the model was connected together as you expected.
* Review Graph Plots. Always create a plot of the model graph and review it to ensure that everything was put together as you intended.
* Name the layers. You can assign names to layers that are used when reviewing summaries and plots of the model graph. For example: Dense(1, name=’hidden1′).
* Separate Submodels. Consider separating out the development of submodels and combine the submodels together at the end.
